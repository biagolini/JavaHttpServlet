# Java HttpServlet Sample Project

This project serves as a simple example of how to use HttpServlet in Java. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of HttpServlet for creating a basic web application.

## Project Structure

The project contains a single class:

- `HelloWorldServlet.java`: The HttpServlet class that handles the HTTP GET request and generates an HTML page with a moving and color-changing box containing the text "HelloWorld!".

## Usage

To use this project, you'll need to have a Java development environment set up along with a web server that supports Java Servlets, such as Apache Tomcat.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Build the project.
4. Access the servlet using a web browser by navigating to the URL where it is deployed (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/`).

## How It Works

When the `HelloWorldServlet` receives an HTTP GET request, it generates an HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. The JavaScript initializes a moving box on the page, which changes its position and background color at regular intervals. The CSS sets the initial appearance and position of the box.

Here's an overview of what the JavaScript code does:

1. Initialize variables for the moving box, its position, speed, and intervals for moving and changing colors.
2. Define a `randomColor` function that returns a random color from an array of predefined colors.
3. Define the `init` function, which initializes the moving box and sets up the intervals for moving and changing colors.
4. Define the `move` function, which updates the position of the moving box and checks for collisions with the edges of the window. If a collision is detected, the box changes its direction.
5. Define the `changeColor` function, which updates the background color of the moving box using the `randomColor` function.
6. Set the `onload` attribute of the `<body>` tag to call the `init` function when the page loads.

That's it! You now have a simple HttpServlet project that demonstrates how to create a basic web application using Java.
